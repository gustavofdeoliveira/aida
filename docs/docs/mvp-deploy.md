We have deployed the MVP on the following services:

-   Frontend: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) üåê
-   Offchain: [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) ‚òÅÔ∏è
-   Contracts: [iExec Sidechain](https://chainlist.org/chain/134), with the ABI's and addresses on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) üîó

## Frontend üíª

The frontend of the MVP is deployed on Vercel, and you can access it by visiting [ipresence.vercel.app](https://ipresence.vercel.app/). The frontend has a CD pipeline that deploys changes on the `main` branch automatically. The embedded frontend is shown below:

## Offchain üñ•Ô∏è

The offchain service provides the backend services for blockchain events interaction. It is deployed on Heroku and also has a CD pipeline that deploys the changes on the `main` branch automatically. However, it is not accessible to the public because it is a backend service. The latest deploy logs:
